# How To

Open *demo.html* to see a list of all the glyphs in your font along with their codes/ligatures.

To use the generated font in desktop programs, you can install the TTF font. In order to copy the character associated with each icon, refer to the text box at the bottom right corner of each glyph in demo.html. The character inside this text box may be invisible; but it can still be copied.

You won't need any of the files located under the *demo-files* directory when including the generated font in your own projects.

# Made with Love

By Dave Balmer (@Balmer), using these tools:

## IcoMoon.io

While these icons are designed from scratch, http://iconmoon.io was used to collect and
convert them into production-ready font files.

## Affinity Designer

Used for design https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/ great design package for Mac.

## Inkscape

Used to render the strokes in the `svg` files. Mostly because Affinity Designer has some
trouble with auto-converting strokes to paths with some odd shapes.
